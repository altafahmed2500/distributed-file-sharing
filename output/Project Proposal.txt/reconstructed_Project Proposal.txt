Project Title:
	Exploring Linear Algebra Techniques in Web Search, Data Mining, and Clustering

Project Overview:
	This project aims to explore and implement various linear algebra techniques utilized in web search algorithms, data mining processes, and clustering methodologies. The focus will be on understanding how linear algebra concepts, such as matrix decompositions and eigenvalues/eigenvectors, contribute to the efficiency and effectiveness of these computational techniques.

Objectives:
	To understand the mathematical foundation of linear algebra techniques used in web search algorithms.
	To implement and analyze data mining techniques that leverage linear algebra for pattern recognition and data reduction.
	To explore clustering methods and understand how linear algebra aids in grouping data points efficiently.
	To compare the performance and accuracy of various linear algebra-based algorithms in real-world datasets.

Background and Motivation:
The application of linear algebra in computational techniques is pivotal for handling large-scale data efficiently. Techniques such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are widely used in web search and data mining. Understanding these methods provides insights into improving search algorithms, enhancing data analysis, and developing efficient clustering methods. This project will build on the work supervised by Professor Carl Meyer and the research by Amy Langville to explore the practical applications of these mathematical techniques.

Expected Outcomes:
	Comprehensive understanding of the role of linear algebra in web search, data mining, and clustering.
	Efficient implementations of various algorithms and their performance evaluation on real-world datasets.
	Insights and recommendations on the applicability of linear algebra techniques in different scenarios.
